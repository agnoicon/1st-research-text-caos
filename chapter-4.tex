\section{Introduction}

The two-phase optimisation via simulation of healthcare Emergency
Departments, ED, proposed in \ref{ch3:Proposed-OvS-ED} was applied
herewith to analyse the administrative strategies leading to optimum
decisions about the physical and human resources of an ED. In particular,
the impact on the economics and the productivity of Sabadell Hospital
ED of different sanitary staff configuration (v.gr., doctors, triage
nurses, admission personnel, emergency nurses, and x-ray technicians)
were analysed. It is a discrete combinatorial optimisation problem.

There are three main issues to be addressed to carry out the evaluation,
namely: the \textit{simulation models} that represent the system under
study (discussed along the previous chapters); the \textit{decision
variables} and\textit{ workloads} used as inputs of the simulation
models; and the \textit{metrics} used to asses the benefits of the
proposal. We have defined some significant workloads and a set of
metrics to observe both functional and performance features of the
proposal. This set of metrics were defined in term of three different
indexes, namely: patient length of stay (LoS) in the ED; number of
attended patients per day (Throughput); and a compound index, the
product of the cost of a given sanitary staff configuration times
patient length of stay (CLoS).

In the following sections, the \textit{decision variables, }the\textit{
workloads}, and the \textit{metrics} are described. Finally two case
scenarios and their results are presented and discussed. 


\section{Field Information of Sabadell Hospital ED}

It was found through interviews with the managers at the EDs of Sabadell
hospital (which provides healthcare services to an average of 160,000
patients/year), it was found that a basic sanitary of its ED staff
is composed by: doctors, triage nurses, emergency nurses, admission
personnel, and x-ray technicians, as shown in \ref{tab:T1}. This
table also shows some characteristics of such sanitary staff, namely:
sort of staff as junior or senior (that represents less and more expertise,
respectively); their respective costs (� \textbf{}%
\footnote{\textbf{It is not an actual euro, could be any currency.\label{fn:euro}}%
}); the operational patient-service-time (hours); and the minimum and
maximum number of each kind of staff.

\caption{Sabadell Hospital ED average of 400 daily incoming patients and its
hourly distribution (February 2010).\label{fig:real-input}}
\end{figure}


In reference to the Sabadell Hospital ED incoming patients, an average
of four hundred of patients daily arrive to the ED of Sabadell hospital.
As example, the statistics corresponding to February 2010, of this
real average number of incoming patients and its hourly distribution
are shown in \ref{fig:real-input}. As stated in \ref{sec:active-agents}
all incomings patients are triaged to identify the acuity of them
and to prioritise their urgency of attention. Thus, the average percentage,
according to the priority level of urgency of attention, of the incoming
patients to the ED of Sabadell hospital is as follows: triage level
1 - 1\%; triage level 2 - 4\%; triage level 3 - 20\%; triage level
4 - 32\%;and triage level 5 - 43\%. Patients identified as triage
level 4 and triage level 5 represent up to 75\% of the total of the
incoming patients to the ED of Sabadell hospital.

\section{Workloads}

In order to analyse the performance of the ED, the real average four
hundred incoming patients daily arrive to the ED of Sabadell hospital
was considered as follows. This real input was divided into four scenarios,
i.e., four different workload scenarios, up to: 4, 9, 13, and 17 incoming
patients hourly, as shown in \ref{tab:scenarios} (i.e., up to 96,
216, 312, and 408, respectively for 24hrs.).

connected and almost ``non'' scattered.\label{fig:3D-scattered-LoS-tpipe} }
\end{figure}
 These different workload scenarios were used to supply different
loads to the ED, whereas the percentage of the priority level of patients
was maintained.

\section{Evaluation Metrics}

The set of metrics used in this work were: the length of stay (LoS)
of the patients in the ED; the number of attended patients per day
(Throughput); and a compound index, the product of the cost of a given
sanitary staff configuration times patient length of stay (CLoS).

Furthermore, the computing time of each of the proposed optimisation
method is measured in order to observe the gains in reducing computing
time of the methodology proposed.\\


All simulations of the ED optimization cases analysed in this work
were carried out in a Linux cluster of the CAOS Department of the
UAB, which has 608 computing cores and 2.2TB of RAM, that is composed
of: 9 nodes of a dual-4 core Intel Xeon E5430, 2.6GHz, 16GB RAM; 1
node of 2xdual-6 core Intel Xeon E5645, 2.4GHz, 24GB RAM; and 8 nodes
of 4x16-cores AMD Opteron ``Interlagos'', 1.66GHz, 256 GB RAM, all
in a switched 1GigE network.


\section{Evaluation Method}

The evaluation of the proposed methodology was aimed to confirm the
correct operation of both the pipeline approach (PA) and the MC plus
the K-means methods, described in \ref{chap3:Math}. To this end,
we have first performed the exhaustive search (ES) to use as baseline
method. The second step of this evaluation consists on applying the
coarse grained phase, using either the PA, the MC plus K-means methods,
or both. Finally, the fine grained phase is apply in the promising
regions found in the previous step. 

In order to evaluate quantitatively the proposal methodology two case
studies were set. The first of them, namely case study A, was performed
using the agent-based ED simulator version 1.1. This case study is
further described in \ref{sub:Case-Study-A}. The second case or case
study B was performed using the agent-based ED simulator version 1.2
(the current version). This case study is further described in \ref{sub:Case-Study-B}.

In both case studies, only patients identified as triage level 4 and
5 are served at the stage of diagnosis-treatment phase, the three
metrics, and the four different workloads stated above were tested,
and the period simulated was 24 hrs., i.e., one day of functioning
of the ED, in all the experiments. Test scenarios and evaluation results
of both case studies are explained in detail in the following sections.\\


It is important to remind that the actions and interactions corresponding
to the admission and triage processes have been totally implemented,
but in the case of diagnostic and treatment phase, respecting to the
priorities of the Sabadell Hospital ED currently only the level 1
was implemented. In such level 1 only patients identified with priority
level 4 or 5 (less urgent, and non-urgent, respectively \ref{sec:active-agents})
were taken care of. Nevertheless, all incoming patients were triaged.
Once patients have been triaged, only patients identified as triage
level 4 and 5 were served at the stage of diagnosis-treatment phase.

\section{Case Study A \label{sub:Case-Study-A}}

The agent-based ED simulator version 1.1, which is shown in \ref{fig:ED-SIM-0},
was used in this case study. In this version of the ED simulator the
diagnostic and treatment phase is only addressed by doctors. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth,height=0.16\paperheight]{figs2/ED_Netlogo-0}
\par\end{centering}

\noindent \caption{ED simulator v1.1. Admission personnel, triage nurses, and doctors
were the sanitary staff considered.}


\label{fig:ED-SIM-0} 
\end{figure}
 The simple patient flow in this ED simulator is defined as follows:
patients arrive to the ED on their own, and waits to be attended in
the admission area. Then, patients stay in the first Waiting Room
(WR) WR1, until a triage nurse call them. After the triage process
patients identified as triage level 4 and triage level 5 pass to a
second WR2, and stay there until a free doctor calls them to begin
the diagnosis-treatment phase, depending on the patient's symptoms,
physical condition, and prescribed diagnosis tests. Finally, patients
are discharged from the ED. 

Therefore, in this case study the sanitary staff considered were:
doctors, triage nurses, and admission personnel. Thus, only \ref{subtab:As}
to \ref{subtab:Ds} were taken into account. As a result, 1,134 ($14D*9N*9A$)
staff configurations were tested for each of the four workload scenarios
of incoming patients stated in \ref{tab:scenarios}. 

Finally, the three metrics above stated: LoS, Throughput, and CLoS
were obtained by applying: the ES technique; the coarse grained phase,
using both the PA and the MC plus K-means methods; then, the fine
grained phase was applied in the reduced feasible region to find the
optimum.

\subsection{LoS Index}

The first objective set was to minimise patient length of stay (LoS)
in the ED, with cost configuration constraint less or equal to 3,500
�. This first index is expressed mathematically in \ref{eq:LoS index}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{minimise LoS}} &  & f(D,N,A)\\
 & \text{subject to} &  & D_{cost}+N_{cost}+A_{cost}\in Cost\leq3,500\:\text{�}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:LoS index}
\end{equation}


It is worth noting that each of the plotted points for the following
four workload scenarios were obtained running the ED simulator as
many times as points are. Each plotted point corresponds to each of
the 602 staff configurations (out of 1,134) that satisfy the cost
restriction.


\subsubsection{First Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 4 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es4-1} to \ref{subfig:km4-1}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es4-1}. The red triangle was the minimum. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}

\par\end{centering}

\caption{Average LoS obtained by the ES. The red triangle was the minimum.
\label{subfig:es4-1}}
\end{figure}


The PA result is shown in \ref{subfig:pipe4-1}, where four regions
can be clearly seen and the red triangle was the minimum. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,height=0.23\paperheight]{figs4/v0/6400-602-25-pipe-LoS-min}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Average LoS obtained by the PA. The red triangle was the minimum.
\label{subfig:pipe4-1}}
\end{figure}
The most important is the bottom region, in which the average minimum
LoS was around 0.5 hours. There were 366 configurations (from a total
of 602 in the feasible region) in this region, which is the one where
the minimum was.

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc4-1}
to \ref{subfig:km4-1}, respectively. The MC method found 75 configurations.
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,height=0.23\paperheight]{figs4/v0/MC/MC-6400-602-25-69-25-75confs-LoS}\caption{Average LoS of 75 configurations obtained by the MC method. \label{subfig:mc4-1}}
\end{figure}
 However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified three different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km4-1}.
The most important cluster was the red one (at the bottom right),
which delimited the region where the optimum was. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,height=0.23\paperheight]{figs4/v0/MC/K-means-6400-602-25-69-25-75-Cluster1-36_Cluster2-27_Cluster3-8}\caption{K-means identified three clusters of average LoS . The red one delimits
the region where the minimum was.\label{subfig:km4-1}}
\end{figure}
 %
\begin{comment}
but the green cluster was also important, because the average LoS
of such configurations were not so different from the red cluster.
\end{comment}


The \ref{fig:3D-scattered-graph-25} shows another way to visualise
the connectivity characteristic of the reduced regions found by the
proposed methodology. The axes of such graph are the equivalent operational
patient-service time \foreignlanguage{american}{(t{*})} of a ``single
one'' sanitary professional of each sanitary staff configuration
(the first column of \ref{subtab:As-pipe} to \ref{subtab:Ds-pipe},
where they were ordered by the PA \ref{eq:Pipeline formula}). In
such figure, the points of interest were the green points, which lie
in the region of interest, where the minimum was, which can be seen
in black triangle. It can be seen that it was not necessary to search
in the whole feasible region, but only in the green connected region.

scenario (4 patients/hour). The average LoS index in hours is represented
in colour, and the minimum is the black triangle.\label{fig:3D-scattered-graph-25} }
\end{figure}


Finally, after separately applied both the PA and the MC plus the
K-means methods, the \textquotedblleft{}reduced exhaustive search\textquotedblright{}
was separately performed in each reduced region identified. The optimum
found per each method: the ES, the PA, and the MC plus the K-means
methods are presented in \ref{tab:4p-a}, where the sanitary staff
configuration (doctors, nurses, and admission personnel), their associated
average minimum LoS, and cost configuration are shown. The three optima
independently found were the same.

From Figures \ref{fig:exp1_20} and \ref{tab:4p-a}, there is a staff
configuration that got the minimum time. Also, in such Figures \ref{fig:exp1_20}
can appreciate that there are many other staff configurations that

\subsubsection{Second Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 9 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es8-1} to \ref{subfig:km8-1}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es8-1}, where the red triangle was the minimum.

\end{figure}
 The most important is the bottom region, in which the average minimum
LoS was around 1 hour. There were 180 configurations (from a total
of 602 in the feasible region) in this region, which is the one where
the minimum was.

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc8-1}
to \ref{subfig:km8-1}, respectively. The MC method found 125 configurations.

However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km8-1}.

\subsubsection{Fourth Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 17 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es17-1} to \ref{subfig:km17-1}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es17-1}, where the red triangle is the minimum. 
\begin{figure}[H]

\par\end{centering}

\caption{Average LoS obtained by the ES. The red triangle was the minimum.
\label{subfig:es17-1}}
\end{figure}


The PA result is shown in \ref{subfig:pipe17-1}, where many regions
can be clearly seen and the red triangle is the minimum.
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,height=0.25\paperheight]{figs4/v0/pipe-sorted-LoS_1\lyxdot 0_min}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Average LoS obtained by the PA. The red triangle was the minimum.
\label{subfig:pipe17-1}}
\end{figure}
 The most important is the bottom region, in which the average minimum
LoS was around than 3 hours. There were 21 configurations (from a
total of 602 in the feasible region) in this region, which is the
one where the maximum was.

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc17-1}
to \ref{subfig:km17-1}, respectively. The MC method found 125 configurations.
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,height=0.25\paperheight]{figs4/v0/MC/MC-6400-602-100-69-25-125confs-LoS}\caption{Average LoS of 125 configurations obtained by the MC method. \label{subfig:mc17-1}}
\end{figure}
 However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km17-1}.
The most important was the green cluster (at the bottom right), which
delimited the region where the optimum was.
\begin{figure}[H]
\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,height=0.25\paperheight]{figs4/v0/MC/K-means-6400-602-100-69-25-125-Cluster1-49_Cluster2-68}\caption{The K-means method identified two clusters of average LoS. The green
one delimited the region where the minimum was.\label{subfig:km17-1}}
\end{figure}


The \ref{fig:3D-scattered-graph-100} shows another way to visualise
the connectivity characteristic of the reduced regions found by the
proposed methodology. The axes of such graph are the equivalent operational
patient-service time \foreignlanguage{american}{(t{*})} of a ``single
one'' sanitary professional of each sanitary staff configuration
(the first column of \ref{subtab:As-pipe} to \ref{subtab:Ds-pipe},
where they were ordered by the PA \ref{eq:Pipeline formula}). In
such figure, the points of interest were the green points, which lie
in the region of interest, where the minimum was, which can be seen
in black triangle. It can be seen that it was not necessary to search
in the whole feasible region, but only in the green connected region.

In the other cases, where the patient arrival increases there are
only few staff configurations around the minimum, or clearly only
one. But not only the patient arrival increases, but also the minimum
average patient stay time, as expected, but also the standard deviation,
patients at waiting rooms, both WR0 and WR1 at times t1, t2, t3, and
t4, and finally the amount of unattended patients increases too. In
\ref{tab:20_40_60_80_I1} all these results are shown. In Figure \ref{fig:exp1_WR}
the amount of patients in WR are shown, WR0 plus WR1, at four different
moments, t1=6,000, t2=12,000, t3=18,000, t4=24,000, during the simulation
for all the seven cases reported. It is noticed when the patient arrival
is high, 17 per hour, patients at waiting rooms increased.

\subsection{Throughput Index}

The second objective set was to maximise number of attended patients
per day (Throughput) in the ED, with cost configuration constraint
less or equal to 3,500 �. This index is expressed mathematically in
\ref{eq:Throughput index}:\vspace*{-0.125cm}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{Maximise patients attended}} &  & f(D,N,A)\\
 & \text{subject to} &  & D_{cost}+N_{cost}+A_{cost}\in Cost\leq3,500\:\text{�}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:Throughput index}
\end{equation}


It is worth noting that each of the plotted points were obtained running
the ED simulator as many times as points are. Each plotted point corresponds
to each of the 602 staff configurations (out of 1,134) that satisfy
the cost restriction.


\subsubsection{First Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 4 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es4-2} to \ref{subfig:km4-2}. \ref{subfig:es4-2} shows
ES results. The red triangles were the maxima.
\begin{figure}[H]

were the maxima. \label{subfig:pipe4-2}}
\end{figure}
 The PA result is shown in \ref{subfig:pipe4-2}, where three regions
can be clearly seen and the red triangles were the maxima. The most
important is the top region, in which the average maximum Throughput
was more than 80 attended patients. There were 440 configurations
(from a total of 602 in the feasible region) in this region, which
was the one where the maxima were.

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc4-2}
to \ref{subfig:km4-2}, respectively. The MC method found 50 configurations.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{}\vspace*{-0.2cm}\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth,height=0.22\paperheight]{figs4/v0\lyxdot 2/MC/MC-6400-602-25-69-25-50confs-Throughput}\caption{Average number of attended patients of 50 configurations obtained

\end{figure}
However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km4-2}.
The most important was the green cluster, which delimited the region
where the optima were.

The axes of such graphs are the first column of \ref{subtab:As-pipe},
\ref{subtab:Ns-pipe}, and \ref{subtab:Ds-pipe}, where they were
ordered by the pipeline approach (PA) \ref{eq:Pipeline formula}.
\end{comment}


Finally, after separately applied both the PA and the MC plus the
K-means methods, the \textquotedblleft{}reduced exhaustive search\textquotedblright{}
was separately performed in each reduced region identified. The optimum
found per each method: the ES, the PA, and the MC plus the K-means
methods are presented in \ref{tab:4p-b}, where the sanitary staff
configuration (doctors, nurses, and admission personnel), their associated
average maximum Throughput, and cost configuration are shown. The
three optima independently found were the same.

The results are shown in the Figure \ref{fig:exp2_80}, where the
blue points are the staff configuration that satisfy the restriction,
while the red point is the minimum. Its configuration is presented
in Table \ref{2o_I_80_20}. It order to get the same time or less,
the superior limit for staff members was increased to: $doctors<9$;
$nurses<7$, and $admissions<5$. This index can be seen as looking
for a staff configuration that guarantee, at least, the same quality
for high patient arrival, 17 per hour, as the same that was gotten
for low patient arrival, 4 per hour.

From Figures \ref{fig:exp1_20} and \ref{tab:4p-b}, there is a staff
configuration that got the minimum time. Also, in such Figures \ref{fig:exp1_20}
can appreciate that there are many other staff configurations that
are quite close to the optimum, but with less cost.

\subsubsection{Second Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 9 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es8-2} to \ref{subfig:km8-2}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es8-2}, where the red triangle was the maximum. 
\begin{figure}[H]

red triangle was the maximum.\label{subfig:es8-2}}
\end{figure}


The PA result is shown in \ref{subfig:pipe8-2}, where many regions
can be seen and the red triangle was the maximum. 
\begin{figure}[H]

were the maximum.\label{subfig:pipe8-2}}
\end{figure}
 The most important is the top region, in which the average maximum
Throughput was more than 150 attended patients. There were 180 configurations
(from a total of 602 in the feasible region) in this region, which
was the one where the maximum was.

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc8-2}
to \ref{subfig:km8-2}, respectively. The MC method found 125 configurations.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{}\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,height=0.25\paperheight]{figs4/v0\lyxdot 2/MC/MC-6400-602-50-69-25-125confs-Throughput}\caption{Average number of attended patients of 125 configurations obtained
by the MC method. \label{subfig:mc8-2}}
\end{figure}
 However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km8-2}.
The most important was the green cluster, which delimited the region
where the optimum was.

configuration (doctors, nurses, and admission personnel), their associated
average maximum Throughput, and cost configuration are shown. The
three optima independently found were the same.

\subsection{CLoS Index}

The third objective set was to minimise a compound index: $Cost\times LoS$,
(CLoS), without any restriction, except the minimum and maximum number
of admission personnel, nurses, and doctors stated in \ref{subtab:As}
to \ref{subtab:Ds}. This index is expressed mathematically in \ref{eq:CLoS index}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{Minimise }CLoS} &  & f(D,N,A)\end{aligned}
\label{eq:CLoS index}
\end{equation}


As a consequence of not having any constraint, 1,134 ($14D*9N*9A$)
staff configurations, that represent the whole search space, were
tested for each of the four workload scenarios of incoming patients
stated in \ref{tab:scenarios}. Each of the plotted points were obtained
running the ED simulator as many times those points are, 1,134.


\subsubsection{First Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 4 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es4-3} to \ref{subfig:km4-3}. The 3D scattered graphics
shown the average minimum CLoS index by its colour. 
\begin{figure}[H]

minimum. CLoS units are in thousands. \label{subfig:es4-3}}
\end{figure}
The green colour represents the value in the vicinity of the optimum,
the lighter green colours were the most relevant. The ES result is
shown in \ref{subfig:es4-3}, where the black triangle was the minimum. 

\begin{figure}[H]

CLoS units are in thousands.\label{subfig:pipe4-3}}
\end{figure}
The PA result is shown in \ref{subfig:pipe4-3}, where the black triangle
was the minimum. Several regions can be seen. The most important was
where the black triangle was. There were 316 configurations (from
a total of 1,134) in this region, which is the one where the minimum
was.

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc4-3}
to \ref{subfig:km4-3}, respectively. The MC method found 75 configurations.
\begin{figure}[H]

units are in thousands. \label{subfig:mc4-3}}
\end{figure}
However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km4-3},
the most important was the red cluster, which delimited the region
where the optimum was. %

\subsubsection{Second Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 9 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es8-3} to \ref{subfig:km8-3}. The 3D scattered graphics
shown the average minimum CLoS index by its colour. The green colour
represents the value in the vicinity of the optimum. The ES result
is shown in \ref{subfig:es8-3}, where the black triangle was the

\end{figure}


The PA result is shown in \ref{subfig:pipe8-3}, where the black triangle
was the minimum. Several regions can be seen. The most important was
where the black triangle was. There were 429 configurations (from
a total of 1,134) in this region, which is the one where the minimum
was.

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc8-3}
to \ref{subfig:km8-3}, respectively. The MC method found 275 configurations.
However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed.

\section{Case Study B \label{sub:Case-Study-B}}

The agent-based ED simulator v1.2, which is shown in \ref{fig:ED-SIM-2-1},
was used in this case study. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,height=0.21\paperheight]{figs4/ED-v1\lyxdot 0}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{ED simulator v1.2. Admission personnel, triage nurses, doctors, emergency
nurses, and x-ray technicians were the sanitary staff considered.\label{fig:ED-SIM-2-1}}
\end{figure}
 In this version of the ED simulator the diagnosis and treatment phase
is more detailed, because the diagnosis tests were done by other agents,
x-ray technicians or emergency nurses, or both. The simple patient
flow in the such current v1.2 of the ED simulator is defined as follows:
patients arrive to the ED on their own, and waits to be attended in
the admission area. Then, patients stay in the first Waiting Room
(WR) WR1, until a triage nurse call them. After the triage process
patients identified as triage level 4 and triage level 5 pass to a
second WR2, and stay there until a free doctor calls them to begin
the diagnosis-treatment phase (interrogation process), depending on
the patient's symptoms and physical condition, patients wait at WR
(Level 1) to be attended by an x-ray technician or an emergency nurse
(to perform some diagnostic tests). After tests, patients come back
to WR (Level 1) and stay there until a free doctor calls them again
(treatment process). At the end, patients are discharged from the
ED. 

It was found through interviews with the managers at the ED of Sabadell
that the 100\% of patients undergo interrogation phase; the 80\% of
patients required to perform some diagnostic tests; and only 20\%
need to apply a treatment. These percentages are common for patients
identified as triage level 4 and 5.

Therefore, in this case study the sanitary staff considered were:
admission personnel, triage nurses, emergency nurses, doctors, and
x-ray technicians. It is a 5D problem. Thus, the \ref{subtab:As-pipe}
to \ref{subtab:XRs-pipe} were taken into account. As a result, 28,350
($14D*9N*9A*5En*5Xr$) staff configurations were tested for each of
the four workload scenarios of incoming patients stated in \ref{tab:scenarios}. 

Finally, the three metrics above stated: LoS, Throughput, and CLoS
were performed using two methods: the exhaustive search technique
(ES), and the coarse grained phase, using only the MC plus K-means
methods. Finally, the fine grained phase was applied in the reduced
feasible region to find the optimum.


\subsection{LoS Index}

This objective set was to minimise patient length of stay (LoS), with
cost constraint less or equal to 5,500�. It is expressed mathematically
in \ref{eq:LoS index-2}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{Minimise LoS}} &  & f(D,N,A,En,Xr)\\
 & \text{subject to} &  & D_{cost}+N_{cost}+A_{cost}+En_{cost}+\\
 &  &  & Xr_{cost}\in Cost\leq5,500\:\text{�}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:LoS index-2}
\end{equation}


It is worth noting that each of the plotted points for the following
four workload scenarios were obtained running the ED simulator as
many times as points are, that correspond to each of the 23,445 staff
configurations (out of 28,350) that satisfy the cost restriction.

\subsubsection{First Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 4 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es4-4} to \ref{subfig:km4-4}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es4-4}, where the red triangle was the minimum.

\end{figure}


The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc4-4}
to \ref{subfig:km4-4}, respectively. The MC method found 600 configurations.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
 However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km4-4},
the most important was the green cluster, which delimited the region
where the optimum was.

method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km8-4},
the most important was the red cluster, which delimited the region

independently found were the same. 


\subsection{Throughput Index}

This objective set was to maximise number of attended patients per
day (Throughput) in the ED, with cost configuration constraint less
or equal to 5,500 �. This index is expressed mathematically in \ref{eq:Throughput index-2}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{Maximise patients attended }} &  & f(D,N,A,En,Xr)\\
 & \text{subject to} &  & D_{cost}+N_{cost}+A_{cost}+En_{cost}+\\
 &  &  & Xr_{cost}\in Cost\leq5,500\:\text{�}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:Throughput index-2}
\end{equation}


It is worth noting that each of the plotted points for the following
four workload scenarios were obtained running the ED simulator as
many times as points are. Each plotted point corresponds to each of
the 23,445 staff configurations (out of 28,350) that satisfy the cost
restriction.


\subsubsection{First Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 4 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es4-5} to \ref{subfig:km4-5}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es4-5}, where the red triangles were the maximum. 

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc4-5}
to \ref{subfig:km4-5}, respectively. The MC method found 1,325 configurations.
However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km4-5},
the most important was the green cluster, which delimited the region
where the optimum were.

\subsubsection{Third Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 13 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es12-5} to \ref{subfig:km12-5}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es12-5}, where the red triangle was the maximum.

\end{figure}


The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc12-5}
to \ref{subfig:km12-5}, respectively. The MC method found 1,100 configurations.

\end{figure}
However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km12-5},
the most important was the green cluster, which delimited the region
where the optimum was.

\subsection{CLoS Index}

This objective set was to minimise a compound index: $Cost\times LoS$,
(CLoS) in the ED, without any restriction, except the minimum and
maximum number of admission personnel, nurses, doctors, emergency
nurses, and x-ray technicians stated in \Cref{subtab:As-pipe,subtab:Ns-pipe,subtab:Ds-pipe,subtab:ENs-pipe,subtab:XRs-pipe}%
\begin{comment}
\Cref{subtab:As,subtab:Ns,subtab:Ds,subtab:ENs,subtab:Xrs}
\end{comment}
. This index is expressed mathematically in \ref{eq:CLoS index-2}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{Minimise }CLoS} &  & f(D,N,A,En,Xr)\end{aligned}
\label{eq:CLoS index-2}
\end{equation}


As a consequence of not having any constraint, 28,350 ($14D*9N*9A*5En*5Xr$)
staff configurations, that represent the whole search space, were
tested for each of the four workload scenarios of incoming patients
stated in \ref{tab:scenarios}. Because this is a five dimensional
problem, the results are only shown in the following Tables, but the
results maintain the same structure as above case studies.

\section{Performance}

So far, only all the experiments and their results have been presented,
but not the execution time of each experiment. All the execution times
are presented in \ref{exe_time}. It had an execution time of 480
secs., per one case. So, approximately 604 hrs. must be needed, in
order to run the 4,536 staff configuration cases.

\begin{comment}
In the first case, where the search space was divided by the patient
arrival, 4 independent runs were gotten. The best only last almost
an hour, but the worst last almost eight hours. For the second approach,
the search space was divided by both the patient arrival, and the
staff configurations, 64 independent runs, and for the same problem
size it last 4 times less than the previous one. However, there are
clearly imbalance cases, in both experiments, since the running for
4, 9, and 13 patients per hour have quite short execution times. The
last experiment was run only for one case of patient arrival, 17 per
hour, the worst case, it had an execution time of thirteen hours using
64 independent runs.

These quite small configurations of an \emph{ED} demand a lot of time
to simulate and optimise only one day, without doing statistical sensitivity
analysis. The bigger and the more detail an \emph{ED} is, the longer
the execution time is.
\end{comment}
Before finishing this chapter, it is worth reminding that one of the
aims of this research is to help ED managers in setting up strategies
and management guidelines to enhance the performance of such critical
system, as a core member of a DSS. Therefore, we must be aware not
only in finding the optimum solution, but also the sort of such optimum.
Recovering from the first index of case study A: LoS for up to 4 incoming
patient and up to 17 incoming patients shown in \ref{fig:pareto-25}
and \ref{fig:pareto-100}. In \ref{fig:pareto-25} there were plenty
of sanitary staff configurations nearby where the optimum were (inside
the red ellipse). Thus, a sub-optimum solution would be a good solution,
because choosing a sanitary staff configuration cheaper than the optimum
the LoS is approximately the same.

\par\end{centering}

\end{figure}


On the other hand, when there were up to 17 incoming patients in \ref{fig:pareto-100},
it is important to carefully choose the optimum, because there were
not many solutions nearby the optimum (inside the red ellipse), and
selecting a sub-optimum solution would increase the LoS.

\section{Discussion}

The most relevant conclusions of this chapter are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The two-phase optimisation via simulation of healthcare Emergency
Departments proposed was applied to analyse the administrative strategies
leading to optimum decisions about the physical and human resources
of an ED. In particular, the impact on the economics and the productivity
of Sabadell Hospital ED of different sanitary staff configuration
(v.gr., doctors, triage nurses, admission personnel, emergency nurses,
and x-ray technicians) were analysed.\\

\item The evaluation of the proposal included the \textit{simulation models};
the \textit{decision variables} and\textit{ workloads} used as inputs
of the simulation models; as well as the \textit{metrics} used to
asses the benefits of the proposal. This metrics were defined in term
of three indexes: patient length of stay (LoS) in the ED; number of
attended patients per day (Throughput); and a compound index, the
product of the cost of a given sanitary staff configuration times
patient length of stay (CLoS).\\

\item From interviews with the managers at the EDs of Sabadell hospital
(which provides healthcare services to an average of 160,000 patients/year),
it was found that a basic sanitary of its ED staff is composed by:
9 possible combinations of admission personnel (junior/senior); 9
possible combinations of triage nurses (junior/senior); 5 possible
combinations of emergency nurses (junior/senior); 5 possible combinations
of x-ray technicians (junior/senior); and 14 possible combinations
of doctors (junior/senior) in which a set of examined cases for each
type of staff were analysed as a discrete combinatorial problem.\\

\item In order to analyse the performance of the ED, the real average four
hundred incoming patients that daily arrive to the ED of Sabadell
hospital was divided into four different workload scenarios, up to:
4, 9, 13, and 17 incoming patients hourly, i.e., up to 96, 216, 312,
and 408, respectively for 24hrs.\\

\item All simulations of the ED optimization cases analysed in this work
were carried out in a Linux cluster of the CAOS Department of the
UAB, which has 608 computing cores and 2.2TB of RAM, that is composed
of: 9 nodes of a dual-4 core Intel Xeon E5430, 2.6GHz, 16GB RAM; 1
node of 2xdual-6 core Intel Xeon E5645, 2.4GHz, 24GB RAM; and 8 nodes
of 4x16-cores AMD Opteron ``Interlagos'', 1.66GHz, 256 GB RAM, all
in a switched 1GigE network.\\

\item The evaluation of the proposed methodology aimed to confirm the correct
operation of both the pipeline approach (PA) and the MC plus the K-means
methods, described in \ref{chap3:Math}. To this end, we have first
performed the exhaustive search (ES) to use as baseline method. The
second step of this evaluation consisted on applying the coarse grained
phase, using either the PA, the MC plus K-means methods, or both.
Finally, the fine grained phase was applied in the promising regions
found in the previous step.\\

\item To evaluate the methodology proposed, first the case study A was performed
using the agent-based ED simulator version 1.1. Then the case study
B was performed using the agent-based ED simulator version 1.2. In
both cases, the three metrics and the four different workloads stated
above were tested, and the period simulated was 24 hrs., i.e., one
day of functioning of the ED, in all the experiments.\\

\item After separately applying for cases A and B either the pipeline approach,
PA or the Monte Carlo, MC, plus the K-means methods, or both the \textquotedblleft{}reduced
exhaustive search\textquotedblright{}, the optimum found per each
method for their associated average LoS, average Throughput, and average
CLoS were the same.\\

\item Using the pipeline approach, PA, as the coarse grained phase of the
proposed methodology and then the \textquotedblleft{}reduced exhaustive
search\textquotedblright{} in the promising regions previously found,
our proposal obtained an improvement up to 95.6\% in the computing
time, whereas using the Monte Carlo, MC, plus the K-means methods
and then the \textquotedblleft{}reduced exhaustive search\textquotedblright{}
in the promising regions previously found, our proposal obtained an
improvement up to 72\% in the computing time, both compared with the
exhaustive search used.
\item The optimum solution not always is the best option; it is important
to take into account the sort of optimum when the solutions are going
to be applied into real problems or decision support systems.

\section{Discussion}

The strongest point of FT-DRB is that it provides a simple but suffi{}ciently
complete and satisfactory solution to the problem of dynamic fault
tolerance in interconnection networks. This constitutes the major
contribution of the method since the most significant information
about a network\textquoteright{}s fault tolerance is whether it can
function at all in the presence of faults. It is also possible to
infer from the evaluation results that FT-DRB do not degrade the performance
of the system in the absence of failures.

As most current routing approaches only treat static failures, it
is not possible to conduct realistic performance comparisons against
them. One of the only proposals dealing with dynamic failures was
presented in {[}66{]} and {[}65{]}. According to their performance
evaluation graphs, their method achieves average latency values of
about 82\%. When applying the same evaluation conditions (3 link failures
in a 16x16 torus network with 90\% of traffi{}c load), the average
latency value of our method is about 95\%. Our method obtains an improvement
of about 70\% because the method presented in {[}66{]} is based on
a variation of the TURN-MODEL routing, which uses non-faulty paths
but lacks of a suitable load balancing technique {[}14{]}.

Three different indexes were set to evaluate the operation of the
\emph{Agent Based Emergency Department} simulator. The results were
encouraging, since not only they showed what it was expected, the
more amount and experienced staff, the less average waiting patient
time is. It is, simulation allows to understand, and analyse better
the problem. \\


However, even with this pretty small problem size the amount of combinations
are large, as well as the execution time. Moreover, the resources
that this problem will demand in order to do statistical sensitivity
analysis for longer periods, first to reproduce, and then to foretell
are huge. Therefore, a better scheme must be done in order to use
more processors, but efficiently, since, at the present time, the
imbalance is great and so the wasted of resources.
