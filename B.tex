\section{Introduction}

The two-phase optimisation via simulation of healthcare Emergency
Departments, ED, proposed in \ref{ch3:Proposed-OvS-ED} was applied
herewith to analyse the administrative strategies leading to optimum
decisions about the physical and human resources of an ED. In particular,
the impact on the economics and the productivity of Sabadell Hospital
ED of different sanitary staff configuration (v.gr., doctors, triage
nurses, admission personnel, emergency nurses, and x-ray technicians)
were analysed. It is a discrete combinatorial optimisation problem.

There are three main issues to be addressed to carry out the evaluation,
namely: the \textit{simulation models} that represent the system under
study (discussed along the previous chapters); the \textit{decision
variables} and\textit{ workloads} used as inputs of the simulation
models; and the \textit{metrics} used to asses the benefits of the
proposal. We have defined some significant workloads and a set of
metrics to observe both functional and performance features of the
proposal. This set of metrics were defined in term of three different
indexes, namely: patient length of stay (LoS) in the ED; number of
attended patients per day (Throughput); and a compound index, the
product of the cost of a given sanitary staff configuration times
patient length of stay (CLoS).

In the following sections, the \textit{decision variables, }the\textit{
workloads}, and the \textit{metrics} are described. Finally two case
scenarios and their results are presented and discussed. 


\section{Field Information of Sabadell Hospital ED}

It was found through interviews with the managers at the EDs of Sabadell
hospital (which provides healthcare services to an average of 160,000
patients/year), it was found that a basic sanitary of its ED staff
is composed by: doctors, triage nurses, emergency nurses, admission
personnel, and x-ray technicians, as shown in \ref{tab:T1}. This
table also shows some characteristics of such sanitary staff, namely:
sort of staff as junior or senior (that represents less and more expertise,
respectively); their respective costs (� \textbf{}%
\footnote{\textbf{It is not an actual euro, could be any currency.\label{fn:euro}}%
}); the operational patient-service-time (hours); and the minimum and
maximum number of each kind of staff.

hourly distribution (February 2010).\label{fig:real-input}}
\end{figure}


In reference to the Sabadell Hospital ED incoming patients, an average
of four hundred of patients daily arrive to the ED of Sabadell hospital.
As example, the statistics corresponding to February 2010, of this
real average number of incoming patients and its hourly distribution
are shown in \ref{fig:real-input}. As stated in \ref{sec:active-agents}
all incomings patients are triaged to identify the acuity of them
and to prioritise their urgency of attention. Thus, the average percentage,
according to the priority level of urgency of attention, of the incoming
patients to the ED of Sabadell hospital is as follows: triage level
1 - 1\%; triage level 2 - 4\%; triage level 3 - 20\%; triage level
4 - 32\%;and triage level 5 - 43\%. Patients identified as triage
level 4 and triage level 5 represent up to 75\% of the total of the
incoming patients to the ED of Sabadell hospital.

All simulations were done using the simulator previously explained,
utilising the \emph{BehaviorSpace} tool, serially and using the cluster
\textit{IBM} of the department, which has 32 Compute nodes with 2

\section{Workloads}

In order to analyse the performance of the ED, the real average four
hundred incoming patients daily arrive to the ED of Sabadell hospital
was considered as follows. This real input was divided into four scenarios,
i.e., four different workload scenarios, up to: 4, 9, 13, and 17 incoming
patients hourly, as shown in \ref{tab:scenarios} (i.e., up to 96,
216, 312, and 408, respectively for 24hrs.).

\section{Evaluation Metrics}

The set of metrics used in this work were: the length of stay (LoS)
of the patients in the ED; the number of attended patients per day
(Throughput); and a compound index, the product of the cost of a given
sanitary staff configuration times patient length of stay (CLoS).

Furthermore, the computing time of each of the proposed optimisation
method is measured in order to observe the gains in reducing computing
time of the methodology proposed.\\


All simulations of the ED optimization cases analysed in this work
were carried out in a Linux cluster of the CAOS Department of the
UAB, which has 608 computing cores and 2.2TB of RAM, that is composed
of: 9 nodes of a dual-4 core Intel Xeon E5430, 2.6GHz, 16GB RAM; 1
node of 2xdual-6 core Intel Xeon E5645, 2.4GHz, 24GB RAM; and 8 nodes
of 4x16-cores AMD Opteron ``Interlagos'', 1.66GHz, 256 GB RAM, all
in a switched 1GigE network.


\section{Evaluation Method}

The evaluation of the proposed methodology was aimed to confirm the
correct operation of both the pipeline approach (PA) and the MC plus
the K-means methods, described in \ref{chap3:Math}. To this end,
we have first performed the exhaustive search (ES) to use as baseline
method. The second step of this evaluation consists on applying the
coarse grained phase, using either the PA, the MC plus K-means methods,
or both. Finally, the fine grained phase is apply in the promising
regions found in the previous step. 

In order to evaluate quantitatively the proposal methodology two case
studies were set. The first of them, namely case study A, was performed
using the agent-based ED simulator version 1.1. This case study is
further described in \ref{sub:Case-Study-A}. The second case or case
study B was performed using the agent-based ED simulator version 1.2
(the current version). This case study is further described in \ref{sub:Case-Study-B}.

In both case studies, only patients identified as triage level 4 and
5 are served at the stage of diagnosis-treatment phase, the three
metrics, and the four different workloads stated above were tested,
and the period simulated was 24 hrs., i.e., one day of functioning
of the ED, in all the experiments. Test scenarios and evaluation results
of both case studies are explained in detail in the following sections.\\


It is important to remind that the actions and interactions corresponding
to the admission and triage processes have been totally implemented,
but in the case of diagnostic and treatment phase, respecting to the
priorities of the Sabadell Hospital ED currently only the level 1
was implemented. In such level 1 only patients identified with priority
level 4 or 5 (less urgent, and non-urgent, respectively \ref{sec:active-agents})
were taken care of. Nevertheless, all incoming patients were triaged.
Once patients have been triaged, only patients identified as triage
level 4 and 5 were served at the stage of diagnosis-treatment phase.


\section{Case Study B \label{sub:Case-Study-B}}

The agent-based ED simulator v1.2, which is shown in \ref{fig:ED-SIM-2-1},
was used in this case study. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,height=0.21\paperheight]{figs4/ED-v1\lyxdot 0}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{ED simulator v1.2. Admission personnel, triage nurses, doctors, emergency
nurses, and x-ray technicians were the sanitary staff considered.\label{fig:ED-SIM-2-1}}
\end{figure}
 In this version of the ED simulator the diagnosis and treatment phase
is more detailed, because the diagnosis tests were done by other agents,
x-ray technicians or emergency nurses, or both. The simple patient
flow in the such current v1.2 of the ED simulator is defined as follows:
patients arrive to the ED on their own, and waits to be attended in
the admission area. Then, patients stay in the first Waiting Room
(WR) WR1, until a triage nurse call them. After the triage process
patients identified as triage level 4 and triage level 5 pass to a
second WR2, and stay there until a free doctor calls them to begin
the diagnosis-treatment phase (interrogation process), depending on
the patient's symptoms and physical condition, patients wait at WR
(Level 1) to be attended by an x-ray technician or an emergency nurse
(to perform some diagnostic tests). After tests, patients come back
to WR (Level 1) and stay there until a free doctor calls them again
(treatment process). At the end, patients are discharged from the
ED. 

It was found through interviews with the managers at the ED of Sabadell
that the 100\% of patients undergo interrogation phase; the 80\% of
patients required to perform some diagnostic tests; and only 20\%
need to apply a treatment. These percentages are common for patients
identified as triage level 4 and 5.

Therefore, in this case study the sanitary staff considered were:
admission personnel, triage nurses, emergency nurses, doctors, and
x-ray technicians. It is a 5D problem. Thus, the \ref{subtab:As-pipe}
to \ref{subtab:XRs-pipe} were taken into account. As a result, 28,350
($14D*9N*9A*5En*5Xr$) staff configurations were tested for each of
the four workload scenarios of incoming patients stated in \ref{tab:scenarios}. 

Finally, the three metrics above stated: LoS, Throughput, and CLoS
were performed using two methods: the exhaustive search technique
(ES), and the coarse grained phase, using only the MC plus K-means
methods. Finally, the fine grained phase was applied in the reduced
feasible region to find the optimum.


\subsection{LoS Index}

This objective set was to minimise patient length of stay (LoS), with
cost constraint less or equal to 5,500�. It is expressed mathematically
in \ref{eq:LoS index-2}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{Minimise LoS}} &  & f(D,N,A,En,Xr)\\
 & \text{subject to} &  & D_{cost}+N_{cost}+A_{cost}+En_{cost}+\\
 &  &  & Xr_{cost}\in Cost\leq5,500\:\text{�}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:LoS index-2}
\end{equation}


It is worth noting that each of the plotted points for the following
four workload scenarios were obtained running the ED simulator as
many times as points are, that correspond to each of the 23,445 staff
configurations (out of 28,350) that satisfy the cost restriction.

\subsubsection{First Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 4 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es4-4} to \ref{subfig:km4-4}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es4-4}, where the red triangle was the minimum.

\end{figure}


The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc4-4}
to \ref{subfig:km4-4}, respectively. The MC method found 600 configurations.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
 However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km4-4},
the most important was the green cluster, which delimited the region
where the optimum was.

Finally, after applied the MC plus the K-means methods, the \textquotedblleft{}reduced
exhaustive search\textquotedblright{} was performed in such reduced
region identified. The optimum found per each method: the ES, and
the MC plus the K-means methods are presented in \ref{tab:4p-d},
where the sanitary staff configuration (doctors, triage nurses, emergency
nurses, x-ray technicians, and admission personnel), their associated
average minimum LoS, and cost configuration are shown. The two optima
independently found were the same.

\subsubsection{Second Workload Scenario}

\ref{subfig:es8-4} to \ref{subfig:km8-4}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es8-4}, where the red triangle was the minimum. 

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc8-4}

However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means

However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;

where the sanitary staff configuration (doctors, triage nurses, emergency
nurses, x-ray technicians, and admission personnel), their associated
average minimum LoS, and cost configuration are shown. The two optima
independently found were the same. 


\subsection{Throughput Index}

This objective set was to maximise number of attended patients per
day (Throughput) in the ED, with cost configuration constraint less
or equal to 5,500 �. This index is expressed mathematically in \ref{eq:Throughput index-2}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{Maximise patients attended }} &  & f(D,N,A,En,Xr)\\
 & \text{subject to} &  & D_{cost}+N_{cost}+A_{cost}+En_{cost}+\\
 &  &  & Xr_{cost}\in Cost\leq5,500\:\text{�}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:Throughput index-2}
\end{equation}


It is worth noting that each of the plotted points for the following
four workload scenarios were obtained running the ED simulator as
many times as points are. Each plotted point corresponds to each of
the 23,445 staff configurations (out of 28,350) that satisfy the cost
restriction.


\subsubsection{First Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 4 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es4-5} to \ref{subfig:km4-5}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es4-5}, where the red triangles were the maximum. 

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc4-5}
to \ref{subfig:km4-5}, respectively. The MC method found 1,325 configurations.
However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km4-5},
the most important was the green cluster, which delimited the region
where the optimum were.

Finally, after applied the MC plus the K-means methods, the \textquotedblleft{}reduced

\subsubsection{Four Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 17 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es16-5} to \ref{subfig:km16-5}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es16-5}, where the red triangle was the maximum. 

The MC plus the K-means methods results are shown in \ref{subfig:mc16-5}
to \ref{subfig:km16-5}, respectively. The MC method found 1,225 configurations.
However, it was difficult to get any conclusion about such region;
therefore, the complementary K-means method was performed. The K-means
method identified two different clusters, shown in \ref{subfig:km16-5},
the most important was the green cluster, which delimited the region
where the optimum was.

Finally, after applied the MC plus the K-means methods, the \textquotedblleft{}reduced

region identified. The optimum found per each method: the ES and the
MC plus the K-means methods are presented in \ref{tab:16p-e}, where

\subsection{CLoS Index}

This objective set was to minimise a compound index: $Cost\times LoS$,
(CLoS) in the ED, without any restriction, except the minimum and
maximum number of admission personnel, nurses, doctors, emergency
nurses, and x-ray technicians stated in \Cref{subtab:As-pipe,subtab:Ns-pipe,subtab:Ds-pipe,subtab:ENs-pipe,subtab:XRs-pipe}%
\begin{comment}
\Cref{subtab:As,subtab:Ns,subtab:Ds,subtab:ENs,subtab:Xrs}
\end{comment}
. This index is expressed mathematically in \ref{eq:CLoS index-2}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{Minimise }CLoS} &  & f(D,N,A,En,Xr)\end{aligned}
\label{eq:CLoS index-2}
\end{equation}


As a consequence of not having any constraint, 28,350 ($14D*9N*9A*5En*5Xr$)
staff configurations, that represent the whole search space, were
tested for each of the four workload scenarios of incoming patients
stated in \ref{tab:scenarios}. Because this is a five dimensional
problem, the results are only shown in the following Tables, but the
results maintain the same structure as above case studies.

\section{Performance}

So far, only all the experiments and their results have been presented,
but not the execution time of each experiment. All the execution times
are presented in \ref{exe_time}. It had an execution time of 480
secs., per one case. So, approximately 604 hrs. must be needed, in
order to run the 4,536 staff configuration cases.

In the first case, where the search space was divided by the patient
arrival, 4 independent runs were gotten. The best only last almost
an hour, but the worst last almost eight hours. For the second approach,
the search space was divided by both the patient arrival, and the
staff configurations, 64 independent runs, and for the same problem
size it last 4 times less than the previous one. However, there are
clearly imbalance cases, in both experiments, since the running for
4, 9, and 13 patients per hour have quite short execution times. The
last experiment was run only for one case of patient arrival, 17 per
hour, the worst case, it had an execution time of thirteen hours using
64 independent runs.

These quite small configurations of an \emph{ED} demand a lot of time
to simulate and optimise only one day, without doing statistical sensitivity
analysis. The bigger and the more detail an \emph{ED} is, the longer
the execution time is.
\end{comment}
Before finishing this chapter, it is worth reminding that one of the
aims of this research is to help ED managers in setting up strategies
and management guidelines to enhance the performance of such critical
system, as a core member of a DSS. Therefore, we must be aware not
only in finding the optimum solution, but also the sort of such optimum.
Recovering from the first index of case study A: LoS for up to 4 incoming
patient and up to 17 incoming patients shown in \ref{fig:pareto-25}
and \ref{fig:pareto-100}. In \ref{fig:pareto-25} there were plenty
of sanitary staff configurations nearby where the optimum were (inside
the red ellipse). Thus, a sub-optimum solution would be a good solution,
because choosing a sanitary staff configuration cheaper than the optimum
the LoS is approximately the same.

\label{fig:pareto-25}}

\par\end{centering}

\end{figure}


On the other hand, when there were up to 17 incoming patients in \ref{fig:pareto-100},
it is important to carefully choose the optimum, because there were
not many solutions nearby the optimum (inside the red ellipse), and
selecting a sub-optimum solution would increase the LoS.

\section{Discussion}

The most relevant conclusions of this chapter are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The two-phase optimisation via simulation of healthcare Emergency
Departments proposed was applied to analyse the administrative strategies
leading to optimum decisions about the physical and human resources
of an ED. In particular, the impact on the economics and the productivity
of Sabadell Hospital ED of different sanitary staff configuration
(v.gr., doctors, triage nurses, admission personnel, emergency nurses,
and x-ray technicians) were analysed.\\

\item The evaluation of the proposal included the \textit{simulation models};
the \textit{decision variables} and\textit{ workloads} used as inputs
of the simulation models; as well as the \textit{metrics} used to
asses the benefits of the proposal. This metrics were defined in term
of three indexes: patient length of stay (LoS) in the ED; number of
attended patients per day (Throughput); and a compound index, the
product of the cost of a given sanitary staff configuration times
patient length of stay (CLoS).\\

\item From interviews with the managers at the EDs of Sabadell hospital
(which provides healthcare services to an average of 160,000 patients/year),
it was found that a basic sanitary of its ED staff is composed by:
9 possible combinations of admission personnel (junior/senior); 9
possible combinations of triage nurses (junior/senior); 5 possible
combinations of emergency nurses (junior/senior); 5 possible combinations
of x-ray technicians (junior/senior); and 14 possible combinations
of doctors (junior/senior) in which a set of examined cases for each
type of staff were analysed as a discrete combinatorial problem.\\

\item In order to analyse the performance of the ED, the real average four
hundred incoming patients that daily arrive to the ED of Sabadell
hospital was divided into four different workload scenarios, up to:
4, 9, 13, and 17 incoming patients hourly, i.e., up to 96, 216, 312,
and 408, respectively for 24hrs.\\

\item All simulations of the ED optimization cases analysed in this work
were carried out in a Linux cluster of the CAOS Department of the
UAB, which has 608 computing cores and 2.2TB of RAM, that is composed
of: 9 nodes of a dual-4 core Intel Xeon E5430, 2.6GHz, 16GB RAM; 1
node of 2xdual-6 core Intel Xeon E5645, 2.4GHz, 24GB RAM; and 8 nodes
of 4x16-cores AMD Opteron ``Interlagos'', 1.66GHz, 256 GB RAM, all
in a switched 1GigE network.\\

\item The evaluation of the proposed methodology aimed to confirm the correct
operation of both the pipeline approach (PA) and the MC plus the K-means
methods, described in \ref{chap3:Math}. To this end, we have first
performed the exhaustive search (ES) to use as baseline method. The
second step of this evaluation consisted on applying the coarse grained
phase, using either the PA, the MC plus K-means methods, or both.
Finally, the fine grained phase was applied in the promising regions
found in the previous step.\\

\item To evaluate the methodology proposed, first the case study A was performed
using the agent-based ED simulator version 1.1. Then the case study
B was performed using the agent-based ED simulator version 1.2. In
both cases, the three metrics and the four different workloads stated
above were tested, and the period simulated was 24 hrs., i.e., one
day of functioning of the ED, in all the experiments.\\

\item After separately applying for cases A and B either the pipeline approach,
PA or the Monte Carlo, MC, plus the K-means methods, or both the \textquotedblleft{}reduced
exhaustive search\textquotedblright{}, the optimum found per each
method for their associated average LoS, average Throughput, and average
CLoS were the same.\\

\item Using the pipeline approach, PA, as the coarse grained phase of the
proposed methodology and then the \textquotedblleft{}reduced exhaustive
search\textquotedblright{} in the promising regions previously found,
our proposal obtained an improvement up to 95.6\% in the computing
time, whereas using the Monte Carlo, MC, plus the K-means methods
and then the \textquotedblleft{}reduced exhaustive search\textquotedblright{}
in the promising regions previously found, our proposal obtained an
improvement up to 72\% in the computing time, both compared with the
exhaustive search used.
\item The optimum solution not always is the best option; it is important
to take into account the sort of optimum when the solutions are going
to be applied into real problems or decision support systems.
\end{enumerate}
