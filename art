\subsubsection{Second Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 9 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es8-1} to \ref{subfig:km8-1}. The ES result is shown
in \ref{subfig:es8-1}, where the red triangle was the minimum.

\label{subfig:pipe8-1}}
\end{figure}
 The most important is the bottom region, in which the average minimum
LoS was around 1 hour. There were 180 configurations (from a total
of 602 in the feasible region) in this region, which is the one where
the minimum was.

The \ref{fig:3D-scattered-graph-50} shows another way to visualise
the connectivity characteristic of the reduced regions found by the
proposed methodology. The axes of such graph are the equivalent operational
patient-service time \foreignlanguage{american}{(t{*})} of a ``single
one'' sanitary professional of each sanitary staff configuration
(the first column of \ref{subtab:As-pipe} to \ref{subtab:Ds-pipe},
where they were ordered by the PA \ref{eq:Pipeline formula}). In
such figure, the points of interest were the green points, which lie
in the region of interest, where the minimum was, which can be seen
in black triangle. It can be seen that it was not necessary to search
in the whole feasible region, but only in the green connected region.

\subsection{Throughput Index}

The second objective set was to maximise number of attended patients
per day (Throughput) in the ED, with cost configuration constraint
less or equal to 3,500 �. This index is expressed mathematically in
\ref{eq:Throughput index}:\vspace*{-0.125cm}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{Maximise patients attended}} &  & f(D,N,A)\\
 & \text{subject to} &  & D_{cost}+N_{cost}+A_{cost}\in Cost\leq3,500\:\text{�}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:Throughput index}
\end{equation}

It is worth noting that each of the plotted points were obtained running
the ED simulator as many times as points are. Each plotted point corresponds
to each of the 602 staff configurations (out of 1,134) that satisfy
the cost restriction.

\subsection{CLoS Index}

The third objective set was to minimise a compound index: $Cost\times LoS$,
(CLoS), without any restriction, except the minimum and maximum number
of admission personnel, nurses, and doctors stated in \ref{subtab:As}
to \ref{subtab:Ds}. This index is expressed mathematically in \ref{eq:CLoS index}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} & {\text{Minimise }CLoS} &  & f(D,N,A)\end{aligned}
\label{eq:CLoS index}
\end{equation}

As a consequence of not having any constraint, 1,134 ($14D*9N*9A$)
staff configurations, that represent the whole search space, were
tested for each of the four workload scenarios of incoming patients
stated in \ref{tab:scenarios}. Each of the plotted points were obtained
running the ED simulator as many times those points are, 1,134.

\subsubsection{First Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 4 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es4-3} to \ref{subfig:km4-3}. The 3D scattered graphics

Finally, after applied the PA method, the \textquotedblleft{}reduced exhaustive search\textquotedblright{}

The results of this scenario, up to 9 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es8-3} to \ref{subfig:km8-3}. The 3D scattered graphics
shown the average minimum CLoS index by its colour. The green colour
represents the value in the vicinity of the optimum. The ES result
is shown in \ref{subfig:es8-3}, where the black triangle was the
minimum.

minimum. CLoS units are in thousands.\label{subfig:es8-3}}
\end{figure}

The PA result is shown in \ref{subfig:pipe8-3}, where the black triangle
was the minimum. Several regions can be seen. The most important was
where the black triangle was. There were 429 configurations (from
a total of 1,134) in this region, which is the one where the minimum
was.

Finally, after applied the PA method, the \textquotedblleft{}reduced exhaustive search\textquotedblright{}
was performed in the reduced region identified. The optimum
found per each method: the ES and the PA are presented in \ref{tab:8p-c}, where the sanitary staff
configuration (doctors, nurses, and admission personnel), their associated
average minimum CLoS, and cost configuration are shown. The two
optima independently found were the same.

\subsubsection{Third Workload Scenario}

The results of this scenario, up to 13 patients/hour, are shown from
\ref{subfig:es12-3} to \ref{subfig:km12-3}. The 3D scattered graphics
shown the average minimum CLoS index by its colour. The green colour
